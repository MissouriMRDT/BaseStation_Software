Rock Name:	Minerals:	Description:
Basalt	Plagioclase; Pyroxene; Olivine; Quartz	Mafic. Mostly black
Granite	Plagioclase; Quartz; Biotite; K-feldpar	Felsic, Porphyritic
Conglomerate	Quartz; Hematite; Magnetite; Calcite	Coarse-grained clastic (fragments) sedimentary rock, Pebbles >2mm in size, set in a fine-grained matrix of sand, silt, commonly cemented with CaCO3, iron oxide, SiO2, or hardened clay
Limestone	Calcite; Aragonite; Dolomite; Quartz	Sedimentary rock 50 or more CaCO3. Usually white, grey, tan
Shale	Talc; Muscovite; Biotite; Chlorite; Quartz	Fine-grained detrital sedimentary rock, consolidation of clay, silt, mud, breaks readily into thin layers, red, brown, black, or grey
Andesite	Plagioclase; Hornblende; Biotite; Pyroxene	Dark-colored, fine-grained, the fine-grained equivalent of diorite
Chert	Quartz	A dense, hard siliceous-rock with low porosity
Sandstone	Quartz; Plagioclase; K-feldspar; Talc; Muscovite; Biotite; Chlorite	Sand-grade clastic-sedimentary-rock, majorly silicate-sandstone
Iron Stone	Goethite; Hematite; Siderite	Iron-rich sedimentary rock, hard, coarsely banded or non-banded, and non-cherty
Siltstone	Quartz; Plagioclase; K-feldspar; Talc; Muscovite; Biotite; Chlorite	Massive mudstone in which the silt predominates over clay, like a very fine-grained sandstone
Pumice	Obsidian	Glassy, highly vesicular, mostly silicic igneous rocks
Slate	Quartz; Talc; Muscovite; Biotite; Chlorite	A fine-grained rock displaying strong slaty cleavage and hence can be split into slabs and thin plates. Most slate was formed from shale during low grade regional metamorphism. Usually gray to black
Gneiss	Quartz; Plagioclase; K-feldspar; Talc; Muscovite; Biotite; Chlorite; Hornblende	Medium- to high-grade metamorphic rock that commonly has a banded structure and is generally medium- to coarse-grained
Marble	Calcite; Dolomite; Siderite	Metamorphic rock containing more than 50% vol. of carbonate minerals; composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals
Schist	Quartz; Talc; Muscovite; Biotite; Chlorite; Hornblende	Medium-grained, crystalline metamorphic rock, split into thin flakes or slabs, distinct foliation
Diorite	Hornblende; Plagioclase; Biotite; Quartz	Characteristically composed of dark-colored amphibole (esp. hornblende), plagioclase (oligoclase - andesine), calcic pyroxene, and sometimes quartz
Rhyolite	Quartz; Plagioclase; K-feldspar	Extrusive igneous rocks, typically porphyritic, with quartz and alkali feldspar, glassy to cryptocrystalline
Phyllite	Quartz; Muscovite; Chlorite	A fine to medium-grained metamorphic rock characterised by a strong foliation and is lustrous, intermediate in grade between slate and schist
Quartzite	Quartz	Metamorphosed quartz-sandstone (metaquartzite) or unmetamorphosed sandstone, consisting chiefly of quartz grains that are so completely cemented with secondary silica (orthoquartzite)
Mudstone	Quartz; Muscovite; Biotite; Chlorite; Plagioclase; K-feldspar; Smectite; Illite; Goethite	A mud-grade clastic-sedimentary-rock, composed of silt and clay, and lithified
Scoria	Obsidian	Highly vesicular, basaltic glass
Dacite	Plagioclase; Quartz; K-feldpar	Felsics comprising >20% quartz and alkali feldspar/plagioclase <0.5, fine-grained extrusive rock
Breccia	Quartz; Hematite; Magnetite; Calcite	A coarse-grained clastic rock, composed of angular broken rock fragments held together by a mineral cement or in a fine-grained matrix; it differs from conglomerate in that the fragments have sharp edges and unworn corners
Serpentinite	Olivine; Pyroxene; Chlorite	A rock composed of one or more serpentine group minerals formed by serpentinization (hydration and metamorphic transformation) of rock consisting almost wholly of ferromagnesian silicate minerals
Gabbro	Plagioclase; Pyroxene; Olivine; Magnetite	A group of basic intrusive igneous rocks composed principally of basic plagioclase and clinopyroxene, with or without olivine and orthopyroxene
Peridotite	Olivine; Pyroxene; Chlorite; Biotite; Muscovite	Coarse-grained plutonic rock composed chiefly of olivine with or without other mafic minerals such as pyroxenes, amphiboles, or micas, and containing little or no feldspar
Kimberlite	Pyroxene; Olivine; Calcite; Phlogopite	Ultramafic volcanic breccia, consisting of major amounts of serpentinized olivine
Amphibolite	Plagioclase; Hornblende; Tremolite	Granofelsic metamorphic rock mainly consisting of green, brown or black amphibole and plagioclase
Calcite	Calcite	Mineral with a vitreous luster, three perfect cleavage planes, and a common rhombohedral form. It is often white or clear in color
Quartz	Quartz	Very common mineral with vitreous luster, no cleavage, and many colors, commonly white or clear. It's most common form is a hexagonal prism, but it can be amorphous
Fluorite	Fluorite	Mineral with a vitreous to earthy luster, one cleavage plane, and a common octahedral form. It has many colors.
